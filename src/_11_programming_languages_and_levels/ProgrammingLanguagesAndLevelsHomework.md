1. What is a Programming Language?
    - A programming language is a formal language used to write instructions that a computer can understand and execute.  
      Examples: Python, Java, C++, JavaScript.

2. What is Code?
    - Code refers to the set of instructions written by a programmer using a programming language to tell the computer what to do.

3. What is Source Code?
    - Source code is the original code written by a programmer in a high-level programming language before it is compiled or interpreted.

4. What is Object Code?
    - Object code is the machine-readable output generated by a compiler from the source code. It’s often in binary form and can be executed by a computer.

5. Why do we need Compilers or Interpreters?
    - We need compilers or interpreters to translate human-readable source code into machine code that a computer can understand and execute.

6. When is a Language Considered Fast?
    - A language is considered fast when programs written in it execute quickly and efficiently, usually because it is compiled directly into machine code.  
      Example: C, C++.

7. When is a Language Considered Slow?
    - A language is considered slow when programs take longer to run, often because the code is interpreted at runtime or adds overhead.  
      Example: Python, JavaScript.

8. What is a High-Level Language?
    - A high-level language is closer to human languages and is easier to read and write. These languages manage most hardware details for the programmer.  
      Examples: Python, Java, Ruby.

9. What is a Low-Level Language?
    - A low-level language is closer to machine code and gives the programmer more control over hardware.  
      Examples: Assembly, Machine Code.

10. When is a Language Considered Human Readable?
    - A language is considered human readable when its syntax is easy to understand and resembles natural language or logical structures.  
      High-level languages are usually human-readable.
