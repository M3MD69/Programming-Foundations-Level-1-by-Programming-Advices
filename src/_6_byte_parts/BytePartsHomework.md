1. What is Bit?
    - A bit (short for "binary digit") is the smallest unit of data in computing and can have a value of either 0 or 1.
2. What is Crumb?
    - A crumb is an informal term for 2 bits. It's not widely used in modern computing but sometimes mentioned in theoretical discussions.
3. What is Nibble?
    - A nibble consists of 4 bits. It is half of a byte and can represent values from 0 to 15.
4. What is Byte?
    - A byte is a unit of digital information that consists of 8 bits. It is the standard unit used to represent a character such as a letter or number.
5. How many bits in a byte?
    - 8 Bits
6. How many crumbs in a byte?
    - 4 Crumbs
7. How many nibbles in a byte?
    - 2 Nibbles
8. How many crumbs in a nibble?
    - 2 Crumbs
9. What is the lower nibble?
    - The lower nibble is the lower 4 bits (least significant) of a byte. For example, in `1011 0110`, the lower nibble is `0110`.
10. What is the upper nibble?
    - The upper nibble is the higher 4 bits (most significant) of a byte. For example, in `1011 0110`, the upper nibble is `1011`.
11. What is LSB? And why do we call it LSB? What is its value?
    - LSB stands for Least Significant Bit. It is the rightmost bit in a binary number. It's called "least significant" because it represents the smallest possible value (2⁰). Its value is either 0 or 1, depending on the data.
12. What is MSB? And why do we call it MSB? What is its value?
    - MSB stands for Most Significant Bit. It is the leftmost bit in a binary number. It's called "most significant" because it has the highest value place (e.g., 2^7 in an 8-bit number). Its value is also either 0 or 1, depending on the data.
