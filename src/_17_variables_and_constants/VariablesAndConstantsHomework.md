## الحل

1. What is a Variable? And why do we need it?
    - A variable is a named storage for data. We use it to store and manipulate values in a program.

2. What is a Constant? And why do we need it?
    - A constant is a value that doesn't change during program execution. It ensures data remains fixed.

3. What is a Memory Cell?
    - A memory cell is a small unit in memory that holds a piece of data.

4. What is an Identifier?
    - An identifier is the name used to identify variables, constants, functions, etc.

5. What is a Memory Address? What is its relation to location?
    - A memory address is the numeric location of a memory cell. It tells where data is stored.

6. Which numbering is used in memory address?
    - Binary (base-2) is used internally; hexadecimal (base-16) is used for human readability.

7. Mention the primary system types of variables:
    - Integer, Float, Character, String, Boolean

8. What are the number types? Give examples:
    - Integer: `10`, Float: `3.14`

9. What is a String? Give an example:
    - A string is a sequence of characters. Example: `"Hello"`

10. What is Boolean? Give an example:
    - A Boolean holds `true` or `false`. Example: `isReady = true`

</div>

1. Are All Variables and Constants Have the Same Size?
    - No, their size depends on their type.

2. What Happens When You Use Much Larger Size Than You Need in Variables?
    - It wastes memory.

3. Can We Modify a Variable During the Program?
    - Yes, variables can be modified.

4. Can We Modify a Constant During the Program?
    - No, constants cannot be modified.

5. How to Make a Variable Read-Only?
    - Use `final` in Java or `const` in other languages.

6. Where Do the Variables and Constants Get Stored?
    - In memory, typically on the stack or in the data segment.

7. What is the Difference Between Integers and Floats?
    - Integers are whole numbers, while floats have decimal points.
