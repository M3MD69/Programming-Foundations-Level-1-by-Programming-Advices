5. What is Ethernet?  
   Ethernet is a widely used networking technology for local area networks (LANs). It uses wired connections to transmit data between devices in a network using a protocol that ensures reliable data delivery.

6. What is Wireless?  
   Wireless refers to the technology that allows devices to communicate over the air using radio waves or infrared signals, without the need for physical cables. Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are common wireless technologies.

7. What is Protocol?  
   A protocol is a set of rules or conventions that determine how data is transmitted and received in a network. It defines how devices in a network communicate, ensuring that information is exchanged correctly and securely.

8. What is Wi-Fi?  
   Wi-Fi is a wireless networking technology that allows devices to connect to the internet or local area networks using radio waves, without the need for physical cables.

9. Wi-Fi stands for what?  
   Wi-Fi stands for Wireless Fidelity. It is a trademarked term used to refer to a set of wireless networking standards based on the IEEE 802.11 family of protocols.
